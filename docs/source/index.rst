`Snakemake`_ workflows can be completed beasts. They can quickly become complex
and opaque to users. Having good documentation explaining what each rule is
doing, what assumptions are being made, and what parts can be configured are
important for reproducable, understandable, and reusable code. `Snakedoc`_ aims
to help with this by:

1. Encouraging developers to write contextual and useful docstrings inline
   with their rules.
2. Providing a way to automatically scrape those docstrings and present them in
   Sphinx documentation where they can be further augmented, as needed.
